    title: 'Getting Started with TaskFlow',
    body: `TaskFlow is a project management tool designed for small and mid-size teams. After signing up, you'll land on your Dashboard, which shows all active projects. To create your first project, click the "+ New Project" button in the top-left corner, give it a name and description, and invite team members by email. Each project contains Boards, and each Board contains Tasks. You can drag and drop tasks between columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) to track progress. TaskFlow supports up to 50 team members on the Pro plan and 10 on the Free plan.`,

    title: 'Billing and Subscription Plans',
    body: `TaskFlow offers three plans: Free, Pro ($12/user/month), and Enterprise (custom pricing). The Free plan includes up to 3 projects, 10 team members, and 1GB of file storage. The Pro plan includes unlimited projects, 50 team members, 50 GB storage, and priority email support. Enterprise includes everything in Pro plus SSO, audit logs, a dedicated account manager, and custom integrations. You can upgrade or downgrade at any time from Settings > Billing. When you upgrade mid-cycle, you'll be charged a prorated amount. Downgrades take effect at the next billing cycle. Refunds are available within 7 days of an upgrade if you haven't used any Pro-only features.`,

    title: 'Integrations',
    body: `TaskFlow integrates with Slack, Google Calendar, GitHub, and Zapier. To connect an integration, go to Settings > Integrations and click "Connect" next to the app you want. Slack integration sends task notifications to a channel of your choice. Google Calendar integration syncs task due dates to your calendar. GitHub integration links pull requests to tasks — when a PR is merged, the linked task automatically moves to "Done." Zapier integration allows you to build custom automations with 3,000+ apps. Integrations are available on Pro and Enterprise plans only.`,

    title: 'Managing Team Permissions',
    body: `TaskFlow has three permission roles: Owner, Admin, and Member. Owners have full control including billing and account deletion. Admins can create and manage projects, invite members, and configure integrations. Members can create and edit tasks within projects they're assigned to but cannot manage billing or integrations. To change someone's role, go to Settings > Team, click the three-dot menu next to their name, and select "Change Role." Only Owners can promote someone to Admin. There is only one Owner per workspace, but ownership can be transferred under Settings > Team > Transfer Ownership.`,

    title: 'Troubleshooting Common Issues',
    body: `Tasks not syncing: Try refreshing your browser or clearing your cache. If the issue persists, check your internet connection and ensure you're on the latest version of TaskFlow. If you're using the mobile app, force-close and reopen it. Can't invite team members: Make sure you haven't hit your plan's member limit (Free: 10, Pro: 50). Also verify the email address is correct and hasn't already been invited. Integration not working: Disconnect and reconnect the integration from Settings > Integrations. Make sure you've authorized TaskFlow in the third-party app's settings as well. Forgot password: Click "Forgot Password" on the login screen. You'll receive a reset link within 5 minutes. Check your spam folder if it doesn't arrive. Reset links expire after 24 hours.`,
